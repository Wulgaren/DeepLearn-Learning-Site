# Edge (html-app on /*): Serves no-JS HTML for /, /topics, /thread/*, /thread/new when client has no dl_js cookie; if cookie present (set by upgrade script when JS runs), passes through to SPA. So: JS disabled → no-JS; JS enabled → one reload then React SPA.
# SPA: serve index.html for all routes so client-side router can handle /thread/:id etc.
